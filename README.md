Database of Songs from World-Class Singers

Project Title: <Database of Songs from World-Class Singers>
Proposal Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F9CxaAAzmAjCWiluIkH-YAJT9fcyjWRoT_EvQz86nqs/edit?usp=sharing

Brief Project Description:
<brief project description here: 1) what will the app that you are developing do, and 2) who would use an application like this and why>
	In this application, the user will be prompted to type a specific, well-known singer, and through hashtable, our application will take the singer’s name (in strings) as the key value and hashes it to a Song object (we will create a Song class containing the singer’s name and his or her top 3 songs). 
[KEY = “SINGER NAME”, VALUE = SONG OBJECT (of singer and 3 top songs]
	The intended users of this application are people who would like to learn more about the music industry specifically in terms of the world-class artists and their most well-known pieces of music. 

Four Chosen Requirements that this Project Fulfills:

<Hash Table Data Structure>: <we will use this to structure our program, specifically from the Back End Developers, the BackEnd will be responsible to create interface of the functionalities of the application>

<JavaFX>: The Front End will use JavaFX to make an in-window view of the interactions available to the user. The user will interact with the text box and buttons in the window to view information, add data, and remove data.

<Streams and Lambda Expressions><The Data Wrangler will use Stream to load the data into the hash table. Then everyone can try to use lambda expression somewhere in their code, probably will relate more to the Data Wrangler and Front End Developers. And since there might be multiple people using lambda expression, there will not be a specific functionality limited to the use of lambda expression in this application>
	
<CSV, XML, or JSON formatted file>: <the Data Wrangler will be responsible to store datas of singers’ names and each of their top 3 songs into either one of those data formats. Then, the Data Wrangler will also be writing a loading class with loading methods to load that data into the application>
