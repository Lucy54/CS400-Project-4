- TestBackEnd.java
- HashTableMap.java
Created test class for week 1 and made final Week 1 push to repo on Tuesday, November 24th before deadline. This file tests the functions of backend.

---------------------
<Replace this with a list your contributions for the week 2 deliverable.

or the data files your created or worked on. If you haven't written any code or
other content that your can commit, provide a list of the work that you did
during week 2. Make sure that all your week 2 contributions and this section
of the readme are committed and pushed to the GitHub repo by the week 2 deadline
on 12/01 at 11:59pm CST.>
- TestBackEnd.java
- HashTableMap.java
- TestHashTable.java
Created the HashTable test class to test data structure. The backend test file is also early since backend uploaded backend file early.

Contributions Week 3:
---------------------
<Replace this with a list your contributions for the week 3 deliverable.
You can list the java files that you wrote and committed during the first week,
or the data files your created or worked on. If you haven't written any code or

during week 3. Make sure that all your week 3 contributions and this section
of the readme are committed and pushed to the GitHub repo by the week 3 deadline
on 12/08 at 11:59pm CST.>
- TestData.java
- TestFrontEndAndLoad.java
Created the files to test data, front end, and load functionalities. Also added to the makefile for the testing components. The file TestData was originally supposed to test that data was being parsed correctly given CSV file formatted with convention where first line describes data (would have used the arrays to compare indices, but since data not formatted correctly, my data test simply tests the elements).

Files written by me:
--------------------
<List ALL of the source files here that were written by you. Note that each of the
files must contain correct file headers, including your name, team, and role. List
files one per line in this section of the README. Only complete this section with
your final week 3 submission of project four.>
- TestBackEnd.java
- HashTableMap.java
- TestHashTable.java
- TestData.java
- TestFrontEndAndLoad.java

Files submitted with this project that were developed in an earlier project:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<If you have any files written by you or your team in your submission that were
written for an earlier project and that you re-used for project four, replace this
text with a list of these files. Provide file name and path as well as the project
that they were originally developed for.>
- HashTableMap.java (Project One, no path b/c in same folder)

Web address at which the program is available:
----------------------------------------------
<If you and your team have written a web app that is available on the internet,
replace this text with its address. This is not a requirement of Project Four
and you will not loose points for not implementing a web application or for not
having a running version on the web.>

Additional notes about the submission:
--------------------------------------
<List any additional notes for the grader here (only required by the final deadline).>
